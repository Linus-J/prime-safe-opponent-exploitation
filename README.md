## Prime Safe Opponent Exploitation

To run tests in the card or bet abstraction environments:

Ensure Python 3, gurobipy, scipy and NumPy are installed and are up to date.

Open your terminal to the folder directory with the source files in and execute:
	For 6 card setting:
		python3 cardKuhn[ALGNAME].py param1 param2
	For 4 bet-size setting:
		python3 betKuhn[ALGNAME].py param1 param2

Parameter 1: 
Choose the level of abstraction for player 1 (Agent player):

	cardEEFEWP: 
	0 - Full game Nash
	1 - Five card Nash
	2 - Four card Nash
	3 - Three card Nash

	betEFFEWP:
	0 - Full game Nash
	1 - Three bet sizes Nash
	2 - Two bet sizes Nash
	3 - One bet sizes Nash

Parameter 2:
Choose opponent class for player 2 (Opponent player):

	0 - Equilibrium
	1 - Sophisticated
	2 - Random
	3 - Dynamic

ALGNAME:

	PRWYWE - Prime Risk What You've Won in Expectation
	EEFEWP - Epsilon Equilibrium and Full Exploitation When Possible 
	EEFFE -  Epsilon Equilibrium Followed by Full Exploitation

	
Edit the source and change the "noExploiting" variable to True or False to test with and without EEFEWP
Manually change the number of iterations if desired (Default: 40,000).

Examples:
	EEFEWP in 6 card setting, Five Card Nash vs Random opponent:
		python3 cardKuhnEEFEWP.py 1 2
	PRWYWE in 4 bet-size setting, Two bet sizes Nash vs Equilibrium opponent:
		python3 betKuhnPRWYWE.py 2 0
